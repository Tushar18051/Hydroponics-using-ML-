Hydroponics ML Dataset
ML-Dataset
A Iot-based Hydroponics system which uses ML to efficiently manage Nutrient rich water for NFT. This dataset contains information about various environmental factors and their corresponding crop recommendations for farmers. The data was collected from various sources, including agricultural research centers and experts in the field. The dataset includes data on the following factors: 1.Nitrogen 2.Phosphorus 3.Potasium 4.Ph value 5.water level 6.Rainfall

The dataset is stored in a CSV format, with each row representing a different observation and each column representing a different variable. The dataset has a total of X observations and Y variables.

Data Cleaning:

The dataset has been cleaned and pre-processed to remove any missing or duplicate values. The values for each variable have been standardized to ensure that they are on the same scale.

Data Usage:

This dataset can be used to develop machine learning models for crop recommendation systems. The model can be trained on the environmental factors and corresponding crop recommendations to predict the most suitable crop for a given set of environmental factors.

Data Citation:

If you use this dataset in your research or publications, please cite the following:
